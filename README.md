# Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster with Talos

**Note: This project is currently a work in progress and will be updated accordingly.**

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster using Raspberry Pi devices and Talos, an operating system specifically designed for Kubernetes. The cluster setup makes use of Terraform for provisioning the required infrastructure components and services.

### Repository Structure
|Directory|Description|
|:---|:---|
|[.talos](.talos)|Contains the Talos configuration files|
|[infrastructure](infrastructure)|Contains all files to setup infrastructure services such as metallb, ingress-nginx, storage, ...|
|[apps](apps)|Contains all files to setup applications such as home-assistant, nextcloud, ...|
|[`rdmassets`](rdmassets)|Contains images and other assets used in the README|
