# Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster with Talos

Work in progress...

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a Kubernetes cluster on Raspberry Pi devices using Talos, an OS designed specifically for Kubernetes. The cluster setup utilizes Terraform for provisioning the necessary infrastructure components but also services.
