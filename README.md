# Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster with Talos

This project aims to set up a Kubernetes cluster using three Raspberry Pis running Talos as the operating system. The cluster is provisioned and managed using Terraform and Helm, providing a learning opportunity for beginners like me in the field who want to gain hands-on experience with industry-standard practices.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a Kubernetes cluster on the Raspberry Pi devices using Talos, an OS designed specifically for Kubernetes. The cluster setup utilizes Terraform for provisioning the necessary infrastructure components but also services.
